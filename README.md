# Good-Readme-Generator

For this project, my goal was to generate a fresh README markdown file through the backend using node.js. 
This README is designed to deploy general information about the application, the installation process, usage, licensing, the contributors and questions.
A table of contents are also listed to help the user with easier navigation around the markdown page. The entire README markdown file is generated through as series of questions prompted to the user in the command line. This was done by using the inquirer module in node.js. Not only does this create a fast and seamless user experience but it also gives the contributor flexibility in how they would like to answer their questions. The username and email that the user inputs will be used imported in the "contact" portion of the markdown file as well.

Below is a video on how this program works:
